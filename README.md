# Movie App 3
Movie App 3 is based on the previous work. With the latest updates, I've introduced a robust object-oriented programming (OOP) approach that makes the code more modular and easier to maintain. The new design includes classes for the Movie App and an interface that abstracts the storage options and provides flexibility and scalability.

## Project history
- **Movie Project 1**: The first version of Movie Project, a Python-based film management application. This programme allows users to seamlessly add, update, delete and perform fuzzy searches for movies via the command prompt. With bright console colours that enhance user interaction, users can effortlessly organise their movie collection. The core functionality of this project was developed using Python.
- **Movie Project 2**: The second version of the Movie Project uses an API to seamlessly retrieve detailed film information. By integrating an HTML template, users can now explore and retrieve film data with improved graphics and easy navigation. The core functionality of this project was also developed using Python.


## Features:
1. **API Integration**: Utilizes an API to fetch comprehensive film data, including details such as plot summaries, cast and crew information, ratings, and more.

2. **HTML Template**: Enhances user interface with a structured HTML layout, improving visual appeal and providing a more intuitive navigation experience.

3. **Classes Integration**: The application now contains special classes to encapsulate the various components and functions of the Movie App. This structure promotes better organisation and reusability of the code.

## Core Functionality
The core functionality of Movie Project 3 is built using Python, focusing on API integration to fetch movie details and incorporating an HTML template to enhance the user interface.
